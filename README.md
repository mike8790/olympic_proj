# olympic_proj
Fun project to play around with Python for data analysis/ science as I extend my
In particular working with Python/ postgreSQL and eventually a data-visulisation tool (likely PowerBI).

Will be added to inconsistently as I find time and get ideas of how to add

## To do?
+ Calculate correlation between avg. ranking in previous Olympics and performance in most recent Olympics
+ Create report to show effects of population and GDP on average performance?
+ Add other factors to the table - identify potential factors of interest and access relevant data
+ Expand beyond simple correlation analyses and descriptive statistics - perhaps multivariate regression
+ Transfer data from multiple CSVs to a SQL database

## Missing data from worldbank lists-
From nominal GDP and population list = Taiwan (Chinese Taipei)

Because of different naming conventions - certain countries I have decided on using a specific name, whenever I extract new CSV etc I will manually adapt these.
Largely tried to keep countries to single word - so if prefixes or suffixes e.g. 'democratic repulic of' or 'peoples repulic' etc I have removed.
